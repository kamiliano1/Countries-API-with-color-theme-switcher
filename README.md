## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Local Storage for saving actual theme mode
- [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) - API for countires details
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwind CSS
- [Icons](https://icones.js.org/) - For icons


### What I learned

This was my second time working with Tailwind CSS. For the text formatting, I'm going well but I still have a problem with preparing properly grid templates according to the design.

### Continued development

This project might be extended by filtering country by population or giving a user abilitiy to add additional information that is provided by API but wasn't included in the web.
